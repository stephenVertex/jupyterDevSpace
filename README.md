# Introduction

This repository contains a [Jupyter Lab installation](https://jupyter.org/).

This repository should start a Jupyter lab on its own, but if it does not,
click on the link as show in the script.

This will open up a new tab running Jupyter on your DevSpace.

# Using the Jupyter VSCode Extension

You can add the Jupyter VSCode Extension. See:

![Jupyter VS Code](./imgs/vs-code-ext.png)

Make sure to set the kernel to the one in `~/.pyenv`.
That can be done as follows.

You can then work in directly from DevSpaces and not the second browser tab.

*NOTE:* At present, the Jupyter VSCode Extension only works for x86.
